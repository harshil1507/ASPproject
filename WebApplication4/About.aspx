    <p>Since childhood, I have enjoyed exploring and dabbling with computers and experimenting
with various computer applications. With the evolution of computers, we are using them
almost everywhere. Computers can be found in medical, automobile, transport, aerospace,
education and pretty much everywhere in the world.I have an appreciation for the grandeur
of this field and the nearly endless possibilities for further study. In the midst of this
technological and computing revolution, which will change our life drastically, I am very
excited at the prospect of devoting my career to such a dynamic and fast-advancing field
and accordingly, I have been pursuing my education.</p>
